# Is Rick Inside?
> ## Overview
> A 'Rickroll' is a form of online trolling in which a clip of the song _[Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)_ by Rick Astley is played on an unsuspecting person's device. \
This harmless prank was reproduced so widely that many users began to doubt every link sent to them for fear of being 'rickrolled' once again.
>
> The essence of a 'rickroll' is playing the clip unexpectedly, with YouTube hyperlinks being the easiest method. For those paranoid users, _Is Rick Inside?_ is the perfect companion to stand against any unknown links shared with them.
>
> _Is Rick Inside?_ is one of its kinds of models. \
>Unlike other contemporary rickroll detectors, which rely on references to 'rickroll' in the video hyperlink, description, or comments and produce probabilities, _Is Rick Inside?_ examines each frame of the video and yields a definite output! \
Additionally, it maintains indices of links as dictated by the user's feedback. This helps it recall any links which it tested previously.
